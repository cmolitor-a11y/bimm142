## Background
 
 The goal of this mini-project is for you to explore a complete analysis using the unsupervised learning techniques covered in class. You’ll extend what you’ve learned by combining PCA as a preprocessing step to clustering using data that consist of measurements of cell nuclei of human breast masses. This expands on our RNA-Seq analysis from last day.
 
## Data import
Data was downloaded from the class website as a CSV file

```{r}
wisc.df <- read.csv("WisconsinCancer.csv", row.names=1)
```
